PROGRAM:
    class Person{
        String name;

        void printDetails(){
            System.out.println("name is=" + name);
        }
    }

    class Application{
        public static void main(String[] args){
            Person p1 = new Person();
            p1.printDetails();
        }
    }

OUTPUT
name is=null

-Notes for Program
	-the feild had no set value so for string it will say null

PROGRAM
  class Person{
	
    String name;
	
	Person(String inputname){
		name = inputname;
	}

        void printDetails(){
            System.out.println("name is=" + name);
        }
    }

    class Application{
        public static void main(String[] args){
            Person p1 = new Person("sai");
            p1.printDetails();
        }
    }  

-Notes on program
	-the previous program says that p1 is person named"sai"
	-this program does previous in one step
	-this program enforces that you cannot create a person without a name
	-in this program the method person in the class person takes on imput
of type stringand name imput which is assighned name

PROGRAM
    Person p1 = new Person("sai");

SYNTAX
 Person(String  inputname){

-Notes on program: CHARACTERISTICS
	-has the same name as class
	-doesn't return anything
	-The parameters are just like any other methods where you can 
have 0 or multiple parameters.
	-This is method is called when you are creating the object and 
hence it is called Constructor
