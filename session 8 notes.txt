-Connecting class method and class feild
PROGRAM
    Car c1 = new Car();
    c1.name = "bmw";
    c1.horsePower = 200;
    c1.start();
    c1.stop();

    Car c2 = new Car();
    c2.name = "honda";
    c2.horsePower = 50;
    c2.start();
    c2.stop();

OUTPUT
starting
stopping
starting
stopping

-Notes on the program
	-The output of the program says stopping and starting two times 
but it doesnt specify what vehicle is starting/stopping

-We can enhance this program by specifying the vehicle and horsepower, this is how
feilds and methods are connected

PROGRAM
public class Car {
	String name;
	int horsePower;

	void start() {
		System.out.println("starting : " + name + " which has:" + horsePower + " horse power");
	}

	void stop() {
		System.out.println("stopping: " + name);
	}
}

OUTPUT
starting : bmw which has:200 horse power
stopping: bmw
starting : honda which has:50 horse power
stopping: honda

-Notes on the program
	-Even though we have not defined name in the method start we czn access
it because it is part of the class

PROGRAMpublic class Application {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Car c1 = new Car();
		c1.name = "bmw";
		c1.horsePower = 200;
		c1.start();
		// Start one more time and see what happens
		c1.start();
		c1.stop();

		Car c2 = new Car();
		c2.name = "honda";
		c2.horsePower = 50;
		c2.start();
		c2.stop();

	}
}

OUTPUT
starting : bmw which has:200 horse power
starting : bmw which has:200 horse power
stopping: bmw
starting : honda which has:50 horse power
stopping: honda

-Notes on the program
	-This is starting the car twice, but the car already started once, we
have to fix this

-Boolean
	-Like there is string, integer, double there is boolean
	-Boolean is a data type used when you can take yes or no
