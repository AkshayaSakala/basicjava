The computer is composed of hardrive and softdrive
- Hardware:something you touch(inside and outside the device)
	-CPU: Central Processing Unit; like the brain
	-Hard disk:used to save permanently; like a notebook  
	-Ram: Used for things to be done temporarily; like a scratchpad
- Software:also called programs
	-Softwares do one specific thing and interact with each other
	-Operating System(OS) is a software that starts the computer
	-The OS is the software you interact to run other programs
	-Examples of OS: Xp, OS, Linux, etc
	-Programs are a series of stes/ actions
Decimal System
- what we use on a daily bases
- this system has a base of 10
- the numbers in this system ar 0 thru 9(10 numbers)
Binary System
- this system has a base of 2 not 10
- the number has to be either 0 or 1(2 numbers)
- each place value is a multiple of 2
- 1(2 to the power of 0), 2(2 to the power of 1), 4(2 to the power of 2), 8(2 to the power of 3), 16(2 to the power of 4),
  etc
Why do we learn binary?
- The hardware can only register 0 or 1, and it is up to the software to develop some code words. For example,
  A is 65, a is 97, B is 66, b is 98, etc. This is called ASCII (American Standard Code Information Interchange).
  The computer has to convert everythinhg into number. For example, HELLO (72 69 76 76 79) can be converted into 1001000
  1000101 1001100 1001100 1001111.
