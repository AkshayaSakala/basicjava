-Input from user

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Application {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.print("first number:");
		Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
		int firstNumber = scanner.nextInt();
		
		System.out.print("second number:");
		int secondNumber = scanner.nextInt();

-Notes for the program
	-variable is scanner of type Scanner
	-nextInt()=User Imput

-Steps to writing a program
	-Step 1: understand what the program is supposed to do, and then
visualize what the program will look like
	-Step 2:think about how you would solve this on a notebook, and then 
take a few examples and run them through your mind
	-Step 3:Write Syntax for program before starting. Example: Use syntax
to convert into the program
 	if(){

   	}else{

    	}

-Another conditional program
                int x = 5;
		int y = 2;
		System.out.println(x/y);

		double x1 = 5;
		double y1 = 2;
		System.out.println(x1/y1);

-Notes on the program
	-The first program will result in 2
	-The second program will result in 2.5

-Operator %:find the remainder
	-5 % 2 = 1
	-6 % 2 = 0
	-7 % 2 = 1
	-8 % 2 = 0

Reminder program:
-Remainder program pseudo logic:using % to find weather a number is even/odd
	-If the number %2 value is 0 then the number is even, otherwise it is
odd

Reminder program:
 import java.util.Scanner;

public class Application {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.print("give number:");
		Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
		int number = scanner.nextInt();
		
		// number % 2 is zero it is even
		// else it is odd
		
		if(number %2 == 0) {
			System.out.println(number + " is even");
		}else {
			System.out.println(number + " is odd");
		}

	}
}

Loop program:
-For loop program pseudo logic
	-take a number given be user and multiple it by the numbers 1-10
	-number=user imput
	-starts from 1-10:number * counter

-Loop program syntax
    for( ;   ;  ){
    }

-Actual program logic 
 	-Step 1: Initialization;i=1
	-Step 2: Condition;number <=10
	-Step 3: Increment; i=i+1
	-Body of the for; int answer = number * i; System.out.println(answer)

Final loop program:
import java.util.*;
public class Application {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("table number:");
		int number = scanner.nextInt();
		for(int i=1; i<=10; i++) {
			int answer = number * i;
			System.out.println(number + " *" + " " + i + " = " + " " + answer);
		}
	}
}
