-Declaring a variable
	-Variable names: int(integer),String,Double
	-int age = 12;
	-String name = "Akshaya";
	-Double cost = 12.50;

-Creating your own variable: define your own data type using basic data types
	-you can use a single variable to describe a person(name, age, grade,
etc.) use one variable like p.
	-kind of like building a shape using blocks

-PROCESS
	-Make the class, that is not public static void; 
(Program)
    class Person{

    }

    class yourdatatypename{

    }
	
(Program)
    class Person{
        int age;
        int name;
        int grade;
        int height;
        int weight;
    }

-Using this data type
(Process)
	-make another class this one is public static void
	-print the statement about the description(System.out.println("Person Description"))
	-define the variable (Example: data type is Person and variable is 
person1)
	-add to the line new indicating that I want a new value for the data
type I created(Example: Person person1 = new Person();)
	-add the variable and age, name grade, etc.by using a dot to seperate
(Example:  person1 and then . (dot) and then one of the property you have 
defined in the class)
(Program)
    Person person1 = new Person();
    person1.age = 20;
    person1.name = "sai";
    person1.grade = 7;
    person1.height = 5;
    person1.weight = 100;
