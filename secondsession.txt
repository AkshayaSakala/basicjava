-8 bits=1 byte(8 bits can hold 256 values which is enough for all 
characters according to ASCII)
-1024 bytes=1 kilo byte
-1024*1024=1 mega byte
-1024*1024*1024=1 giga byte

-Details of out computer
	-Memory(RAM): measured in GB
	-Hard Disk: measured in GB(there is more GB of hard disk 
because more ore items need to be stored permenently)

-file: a group of bytes
	-.txt=text file
	-.png,.jpg=picture files
	-.mp4=videos

	-md=make directory
	-cd=change directory

-absolute path:a way to get from the root to a specific folder
	-example= if you have to get to root from 0709 you need to
go to class to math to algebra and finally to 0709 so you can do this 
c:\class\math\algebra\0709 

-eclipse:a platform to make programs; called IDE(Interactive Development 
Environment)

Note: We learned how to make a simple program called HelloWorld on Eclipse 
to give us a glimpse into programming
