-Variables:change it's value by assighning it to another value
	-Examples: x=2: x=3

-Constants: numbers that never change(2 or 3 above)

-Data Type: must specify what type of fat you need (age=12: grade=7)
	-Integers(Int)- numbers without decimals(10, 20, 32)
	-String- series of alphabets(Akshaya, April)
	-Double- numbers with decimals(27.5, 48.73)
	-Boolean- True or False

-Format
	-Datatype VariableName = value ;(int age=12)
	-Strings are represented in double quotes("")(string street name=
 "Akshaya")

-Syntax:grammer to programming
	-ex:;(semicolon), =(equal), "()"(paranthesis)

-If Statement:change of path based on certain conditions
	-this is represented by: if, else if, else
	
Program:
 int age = 13;

    if( age > 15){
        System.out.println("you can get drivers permit");
    }else if( age == 15){
        System.out.println("Congratulations. today is the day where you can apply for permit.");
    }else{
        System.out.println("Sorry, please wait till you get 15");
    }
(This program will print running 10 times)

- Notes of program:
	-int age = 13---variable
	-if( age > 15) System.out.println("you can get drivers permit")--- If 
age is greater(>)than 15 print out statement
	-else if(age == 15) System.out.printl(Congratulations. today is the 
day where you can apply for permit.") --- If you are equal to 15 years old(==)
print oy statement
	-else --- If you don't match any of the above conditions, you are not
ready to get your permit

-Syntax for program
	-"="means assigning value to variable
	-"==" means comparing age to value: age==15
	-">"greater than: age > 15
	-"{}" set of instructions that are related (such as in the same
condition) inside the two curly brackets

-Looping:repeating
	-Example(real life situation)...running on a trach 10 times
	
Loop Program
int i;  // For counting in loops usually variable name 'i' is used 

    for(i=0 ; i<10 ; i++){
        System.out.println("running :" + (i+1));
    }

-Notes on program: Steps
	-Step 1:i=1
	-Step 2:i<10
	-Step 3:System.out.println("running " + (i+1)) ( prints "running 1")
	-Step 4:i=i+1
	-Step 5:i<10
	-Step 6:System.out.println("running " + (i+1)) ( prints "running 1")
	-Repeat this until i<10 is proven false

-Notes on program
	-program states running 10 times
	-initially 1=0 then the loop starts

-Syntax for program
  for( initialiation_onetime ; condition_which_should_return_true_or_false ; do_some_increment_which_runs_for_each_loop){
        somestatements_which_will_execute_aslongas_theconditionis_true
    }

	-Step 1: create a starting value 
	-Step 2: condition that is true or false: if false than do not go to 
the next step
	-Step 3: execute statement if condition is prove true
	-Step 4: increase statement be some increment that runs for each loop
	-Step 5: continue the loop until the condition is proven false

-Naming variables
	-bad examples: int x, String y, double z
	-good examples: int age, string name, double price

-Commenting:start comment with //
	-ex://This is a progra to determine if you can get your permit

-Indentation: indenting is important for readability and identifying mistakes

-Fixing Syntax: Eclipse will sho a red circle and if you hover to see the error
to fix

-Matching Curly Brackets:curly brackets must come in pairs; a block is inside 
two curly brackets
